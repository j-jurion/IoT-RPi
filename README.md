# IoT-RPi

By running 'INSTALL.sh', the mosquitto MQTT software is installed and the service is enabled on the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi can now act as an MQTT broker by publishing topic-value pairs to its IP address.

In the 'test/' folder, a 'publish.sh' and 'subscribe.sh' script are available to test mosquitto locally on the Raspberry Pi.
